## Introduction
As after Lockdown 2020, many people have lost their jobs, so they are moving towards small-scale
Businesses. At this time the demand for an affordable INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is high as
it is quite difficult to handle all these things manually while operating a store.
So, our main goal is to provide an affordable, efficient, productive, easy to use store management system to
the small-scale business owners for their day-to-day business activities.

## Problem Introduction
The major problems of these small scales business are: -
- Generation of Invoices.
- Keeping the record of business transactions.
- Keeping the records of goods.
- Tracking Customer Behavior.
- Collecting Customer Data.
So, all these things are not possible manually for 100-200 transactions in a single day. So, we are working on
this project so that these things can be easily managed by a software called Inventory Management System.
It can help the business owners to increase their productivity and to track Customer behaviors accordingly.

## Objective
- The main objective is to increase the productivity of a store by making things digital.
- It is difficult to do business and customer behaviors analytics with manual processing of data. So
with the help of a software, it is quite simple and easy.

- Improve access and reduce inequity.
- To give some business predictions to the owner so that they can plan their strategies and can
increase their profits.
- To provide an efficient user friendly and easy to use GUI software
